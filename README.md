# Haskell solutions for 2016 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

These little solutions are optimised for tidiness rather than speed of
writing. In some cases I've code-golfed them for performance or
elegance, in the interest of learning new tools and techniques.

## Usage

With [stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/) installed:
```
stack setup
stack build
stack exec adventofcode2016 [DAYNUM]
```
where `DAYNUM` is the number of one of the days of Advent!
